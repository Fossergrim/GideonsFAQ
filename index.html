        <p>ALL of the top web browsers inspect the security of websites you visit and block elements from sites that are deemed either insecure or have mixed security.</p>
        <p>Our print portal is has been classified as a "Mixed Security" site.<br> This means some functions or pages have call-backs/links, in the code, to functional elements within our site which may not have security attached to them.<br>Even though the destination of these links and calls cannot be accessed by a user, web browser algorithms prioritize security over accessability, enforce their security measures, and block some of these elements by default.</p>
        <p>To remedy this you have to adjust the "Site Settings" in your browser to gain full functionality of our print portal, including pop-up windows, file uploads, and some design features.<br>Follow the steps for your browser below to gain full functionality:</p>

              <ul><li>If you <b>CAN</b> see the product you want to order you aren't required to log in and you can check out as a guest.</li>

            <p>We protect our customers and their information using the most advanced standards for security. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, for establishing an encrypted link between the server hosting this print portal, our file servers, and applications which are supported by modern Internet browsers.</p>
            <p>SSL technology represents the highest level of security available on the Internet. It automatically encrypts information traveling over the Internet, verifies the identity of the transacting servers through certificates and digital signatures, and confirms that the integrity of message content is maintained throughout transmission.</p>
            <p>ALL of the top web browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Apple's Safari, Microsoft Edge) inspect the security of websites you visit and block elements from sites that are deemed either insecure or have mixed security.</p>
            <p>Our print portal is considered a "Mixed Security" site by the main internet browsers. This means some pages you access on our site may contain links in the code to the back-end of our site that browsers don't consider "secure".<br> These links to files, scripts, and calls enable elements of our portal to function; even though they cannot be directly accessed by a user. Because of this, web browser algorithms block certain site settings by default.</p>

    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <div class="content-inner">
        <p>The formula to answer this question is: Total Time = Production Time + Shipping Transit Time</p>
        <p>Most jobs are shipped out of our facility within 3-10 business days after your order is placed. This is determined by the size of your order and our production schedule.<br>
        Shipping transit time is between 1 to 5 business days and depends on where you're shipping to and the shipping method you selected at checkout.</p>
        <p style="color: #00055c;"><i><strong>Example:</strong><br>
        You live in Los Angeles, CA and ordered business cards to be shipped UPS Ground to your home. 
        <br>For this example, let's say our production schedule is full and we finish/ship your business card 5 days after placing your order.
        <br>Shipping UPS Ground from Nashville to Los Angeles is 4 days. <br>It'd be reasonable to expect that you would receive your order 9 business days after ordering.</i>

        <p>Our shipping providers are:
          <ul><li>UPS (United Parcel Service)</li>
                <li>FedEx (Federal Express)</li></ul></p>
        <p>Typical default shipping methods for each provider are "Ground". However, overnight, 2nd Day, and 3-Day options can be made available upon request.</p>
        <p>We ship to locations in the <u>Continental United States <b>ONLY</b></u>.<br>We <b>Do Not</b> use the United States Postal Service (USPS) - <i><b>No Exceptions</b></i></p>

    <label for="Shipping2" class="lbl-toggle" tabindex="0">I"m not that far from Tennessee, why does it cost so much to ship to me?</label>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <div class="content-inner">
        <p>The printing portal is linked directly with UPS and FedEx, using Allen Printing's account information, to fetch shipping rates. The rate you see in the checkout cart is what we're being charged at the time you place your order.  It can change from day to day; sometimes in the same day (more details below).</p>
        <p>We are aware our rates may not be as competitive as other organizations whose shipping volume is much greater than ours.<br>That said, there are smaller print shops, all over the country, whose rates are higher than ours.</p>
        <p>But to directly address the question "Why is shipping sometimes more than the cost of the product I'm ordering". Here's what we know:</p>
        <ol><li>UPS & FedEx have a floor rate built into their charges, this means there's a flat fee no matter what it weighs or where it's going.<br>We don't know what their floor rate is and assume it changes periodically.</li>
            <li>Typically, when the destination is further from the point of origin the rate goes up. Our UPS Rates as of Feb 2, 2022...
              <ul><li>Nashville to Georgia (zip code 30292) is $23.65.</li>
                  <li>Nashville, TN to Mt. Juliet, TN (a 25-minute drive) is $16.85.</li>
                  <li>Rates to the state of Washington are in the lower-mid $40s.</li> 
                  <li>Juno, Alaska is above $80.</li>
              </ul>
              There are anomalies, too. For example, we've seen an order ship from Nashville to Los Angeles for $21.00 and agree it doesn't make sense.</li>
            <li>UPS & FedEx add additional fees when shipping to a residential address or remote areas. These fees are included in the rate you see at checkout.<br>We cannot see how each shipping charge is itemized when rate is fetched through the portal.</li>
            <li>UPS & FedEx Fuel surcharges change daily.<br>
              There have been instances where a customer was charged $22.00 the day they ordered. When we shipped their order (4 days later) we were charged $24.00.<br>This means we paid the additional $2.00 to ship to our customer. Rarely has this scenario worked to our benefit.</li>

      <div class="content-inner"> 
        <p>This is situational. If you have an account with UPS, FedEx, or a courier service you are responsible to make arrangements with your carrier.<br> We will notify you when your order is ready to ship so you can schedule them to pick up your order at our facility here in Nashville, TN.</p>

        <p>Yes! When your order ships out of our facility, a shipping notification email from our system to the email you provided at checkout. <br>The notification email will contain your tracking number. Here are links to the tracking pages of our carriers.</p>

        <li>In the upper left you will see the <span style="color: red;">*</span><b>Job Name</b>. Give your job a name.  This will be the name of the art <b>file</b> that will be generated, put in your cart, and sent to us for production.<br><i>Example: JSmith Business Card</i></li>

        <img class="graphix" width="558px" height="339px" src="images/Build2.png"><br><br></li>
        <li>Now let's personalize your card. All required fields will have a  <span style="color: red;">*</span>. Data fields are not case restrictive and will display exactly what you've typed exactly as you've typed it.<br>To change the data double-click the data in the field, delete any existing data, and begin typing your information.<br>For this design I typed the Full Name using all capital letters; but not for the title.
      <p><b>Full Name: </b><i>JOHN SMITH</i><br>
      <b>Title or Camp: </b><i>Print Portal Administrator</i></p>

          Note my email address is floating way above my phone number. I would like to move it down to be closer to my phone number.<br>
          Also, if I do this the address will look a little off center so I need to move that, too. Here is how to do that:<br><br>
            <ul><li>Left Click the email address <u>on the card image</u> and a box will appear.<br><br>
              <img class="graphix" src="images/Build6.png" width="735px" height="317px"><br><br></li>
              <li>There are two ways to move this data-field:<br>1. Left click the field and hold the button down on your mouse and drag the address to a more desirable position.<br>
                2. Left click the field and use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the data-frame around.<br><br>
              <img class="graphix" src="images/Build7.png" width="735px" height="317px"><br><br></li>
              <li>Repeat the process with the address (if you desire)<br><br>
              <img class="graphix" src="images/Build8.png" width="735px" height="317px"><br><br></li>
              <li>When finished, my card now looks like this:<br><br>
              <img class="graphix" src="images/Build9.png" width="735px" height="317px"><br>
              <i><span style="color: darkred;">You are not required to make your card look like this. This example follows the standard layout used by The Gideons International.<br>
              This guide only demonstrates how you can adjust the layout to make it more aesthetically pleasing to you.</i></span><br><br></li></li>
            </ul>
        <li>When you're finished, you have 2 options to proceed with:<br>
            1. Click "Add to Cart".  This option puts your artwork straight into your cart.<br>
            2. Click "SAVE". If you are a registered user, you will have access to your files for future use.<br>
          <ul><li>If you have not registered to the website you can only edit the card when it is in your cart.<br>
            Once you've placed your order and checked-out your data <u>is not</u> saved on the site.</li>
           <li>If you ARE a registered user you can SAVE your file to your account and reorder your card at anytime.<br></li>
