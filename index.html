<button class="faq-collapsible">Is your website secure?</button>
  <div class="faq-content">
    <p>This may sound silly to techies, but plenty of people dont understand how secure websites actually work. How can people shop on a website, giving out personal information, and feel even remotely safe? The secret lies in a trusted third party and good encryption.<p>
    <p>We protect our customers and their information using the most advanced standards for security. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, for establishing an encrypted link between the server hosting this print portal, our file servers, and the applications (inclucing browsers) which is supported by the vast majority of modern Internet browsers.</p>
    <p>SSL technology represents the highest level of security available on the Internet. It automatically encrypts information traveling over the Internet, verifies the identity of the transacting servers through certificates and digital signatures, and confirms that the integrity of message content is maintained throughout transmission.</p>
  </div>
<button class="faq-collapsible">What is your privacy policy?</button>
  <div class="faq-content">
    <p>Information submitted on our website to process orders, request quotes or make inquiries is solely viewed by Allen Printing Co.,Inc. employees. This information is used to contact the customer when necessary. No information collected is shared with or sold to any other company or website.</p>
      <ul><li>We do not store your passwords. We can only reset/change your password in the event you forgot it and need it reset.</li>
          <li>We do not store credit / debit card information.</li>

If you do not, the order WILL NOT come through to us.</i></span><br><br>
          This means funds will be captured for payment, but the order does not come through to us. If you do not receive an order confirmation, we did not receive your order.</li> 
          </ul>
        <li>When you return to our site Click PLACE MY ORDER and you will be taken to a new window which will be your order confirmation window.</li>

  </div>
<button class="faq-collapsible">What are your shipping costs?</button>
  <div class="faq-content">  
    <p>Shipping and handling costs depend on the weight of your order, the number of packages that ship and the shipping method you select at checkout. Typically, everything is shipped in a single box.<br><br>
    Our print portal is linked directly with UPS and FedEx to fetch shipping rates and does so automatically using Allen Printing's shipping rates. Rates can only be viewed at checkout and after the shipping address and shipping method is selected.</p>
  </div>
<button class="faq-collapsible">Which shipping methods do you use?</button>
  <div class="faq-content">
    <p>Our default shipping methods are UPS or FedEx Ground. These parameters are defined by the parent company/corporate office.<br>We only ship to locations in the continental United States using the method you choose at check out.<br><br>
    We do not use the United States Postal Service (USPS) - No Exceptions</p>
  </div>
<button class="faq-collapsible">Where can I check shipping transit times?</button>
  <div class="faq-content">
    <p>Since Transit times are defined by the carrier, here are links directly to their pages to get accurate information directly from them:</p>
      <ul><li><a href="https://www.ups.com/maps?loc=en_US" target="_blank">UPS Shipping Transit Times</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.fedex.com/grd/maps/ShowMapEntry.do"  target="_blank">FedEx Shipping Transit Times</a></li>
      </ul>
  </div>
<button class="faq-collapsible">Can I track my shipment once it's left your facility?</button>
  <div class="faq-content">
    <p>Yes! When your order ships out of our facility, a shipping notification email from our system to the email you provided at checkout. <br>The notification email will contain your tracking number. Here are links to the tracking pages of our carriers.</p>
      <ul><li><a href="https://www.ups.com/track?loc=en_US&requester=ST/" target="_blank">UPS Tracking</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.fedex.com/en-us/tracking.html"  target="_blank">FedEx Tracking</a></li>
     </ul>
  </div>
<button class="faq-collapsible">Can I arrange for my own courier/ shipping provider to deliver my order?</button>
  <div class="faq-content"> 
    <p>This is situational. If you have an account with UPS, FedEx, or a courier service you are responsible to make arrangements with your carrier. We will notify you when your order is ready to ship so you can schedule them to pick up your order at our facility here in Nashville, TN. </p>
  </div>
<button class="faq-collapsible">How long will it take to get my order?</button>
  <div class="faq-content">
    <p>The formula to answer this question is: Production Time + Shipping Transit Time = Total Time</p>
    <p>Most jobs are shipped out of our facility within 3-7 business days after your order is placed. This is determined by our production schedule.<br>
       Shipping transit time is between 1 to 5 business days and depends on your location and shipping method chosen at checkout.</p>
       <p><i><strong>Example:</strong> You live in Los Angeles, CA and ordered business cards from us. For this example, we're pretty busy with work and we finish your cards in 5 days. Shipping UPS Ground from Nashville to Los Angeles is 4 days. Therefore, it's within reason for you recieve your cards 9 days after ordering.</i></p>
  </div>
<button class="faq-collapsible">Will I be charged sales tax?</button>
  <div class="faq-content">
    <p>If you are buying and shipping to a Tennessee Address you will be charged tax unless you provide us with a legal Tax Exemption Letter.</p>
  </div>
<button class="faq-collapsible">Will you bill me?</button>
  <div class="faq-content">
    <p>In an effort to keep costs down and to pass those savings along to customers, Allen Printing Co., Inc. does not provide billing or COD shipments for orders coming through this print order portal. We accept the following methods of payment on our secure site: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover Card.</p>

  </div>
<button class="faq-collapsible">How do I reorder?</button>
  <div class="faq-content">
    <p>If the Print Shop allows it, and you want to order a product you ordered before, you can go to your order history and re-order the product without having to enter all the details of the product again.<br><strong><i>NOTE:</strong>This option is ONLY available to registered users of the print portal.</i></p>
      <ol><li>On the account menu, click Order History & Status.</li>
              <ul><li><strong><i>Tip:</strong> When you are on the home page, the account menu may be automatically displayed in a small window; otherwise, look for  to display the account menu.</i>
              </li></ul>
          <li>On the Order History & Status page, find the order you want to place again.</li>
          <li>Click Re-Order.</li>
          <li>If there are multiple items in the order, then the Choose Re-Order Items window will open.</li>
              <ul><li>Click the check-box for any items you do not want to re-order.</li>
                  <li><strong><i>Note:</strong> All items will be selected by default.</i></li>
                  <li>Click OK when you are finished.</li>
              </ul>
          <li>If there is only one item in the order, the Cart will open so you can check out as usual.</li>
          <li>Note the following:</li>
              <ul><li>If the site is configured to limit the number of items (jobs) you can have in the cart (including items saved for later), and you have reached the maximum number of items in the cart, or the re-order would result in the maximum being exceeded, a message informs you when you click Re-Order. You will not be able to place the re-order. For example, if the maximum number of jobs that can be ordered is 5, and the cart has 3 items in it, you will be able to re-order an order with 2 items in it, but not an order with 3 or more items.</li>
                  <li>If you click Re-Order for a digital download order, and downloads are still available on the original order, you are informed. In this situation, instead of re-ordering the product (and being charged again), click the order number on the Order History & Status page. The Order Confirmation page will open, and you can click Download next to the item(s) you want to download.</li>
                  <li>When you re-order a product, its print options or content (in the case of a fixed-content product) may have changed since you last ordered the product. For example, the content of some course materials is more current, special pages or tabs are different, or new substrate or binding selections are available. Messages in the cart will inform you of such content file and/or ticketing (print) option changes. Depending on the product, you may be able to click a link to review the job and select different print options if necessary.</li>
              </ul>
